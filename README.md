This project was creating a day planner that would store plans after a page refresh. I was provided a basic HTML skeleton and css to start with and had to code the time blocks themselves along with the javascript for the page. To get the time, moment js api was used. Bootstrap and jquery were also used for quick HTML and easier javascript.

The acceptance criteria provided were as follows: 
```md

THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

```
